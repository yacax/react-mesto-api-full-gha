# Project Technologies

This project has been built with a stack of modern technologies that provides high performance, reliable, and efficient service.

## Backend

- **Node.js + express.js:** The server-side of the project has been developed using Node.js along with the Express.js framework. These technologies enable us to build a fast, flexible, and scalable API.

- **MongoDB + Mongoose:** The application data is stored in MongoDB, a powerful NoSQL database. Mongoose, an elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js, has been used as a MongoDB controller. It provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model our application data.

- **jsonwebtoken:** User authentication and authorization is managed through JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). It allows the server to securely verify users and maintain session information.

- **Joi & Celebrate:** Input validation is handled by Joi and Celebrate libraries, ensuring the data we receive is both valid and secure.

- **pm2:** The PM2 process manager has been used for managing and maintaining the application's processes.

- **Nginx:** Nginx, a robust, high performance HTTP server and reverse proxy, is used to manage and direct traffic to the application.

- **cors npm-package:** The Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) npm package has been used to enable CORS with various options.

## Frontend

- **React:** The client-side of the project has been developed using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- **JavaScript + JS interactive + JS form validation:** JavaScript, along with its interactive features and form validation capabilities, has been used extensively for building dynamic and interactive UI components.

- **Flash Box & Grid Layout:** The Flash Box and Grid Layout techniques are used for designing and structuring the application's layout.

- **Media queries:** Media queries have been used to make the application responsive, thus optimizing it for various device sizes and resolutions.

- **Fonts import & optimization:** Custom fonts have been imported and optimized for better performance and aesthetic appeal.

- **Images optimization:** Image files have been optimized to improve loading times and overall performance.

- **Debugging:** The application has been thoroughly debugged to ensure smooth and error-free operation.

- **UX optimization:** The user experience (UX) has been optimized to make the application intuitive and user-friendly.

## Tools

- **Git:** Git has been used for version control, enabling collaborative development and efficient management of the project's codebase.

- **Figma:** Figma has been used for designing UI/UX elements and for prototyping.

- **GitHub & GitPages:** The codebase is hosted on GitHub, and GitPages has been used for the project's documentation and presentation.
